# UFO Sightings Data Filter HTML/Java

## Background
----------------

The goal of this analysis was to create an interactive webpage that allows one or more of five designated search criteria to filter through UFO sightings data. The filters can be input directly on the active webpage, which are then used to re-filter the data based on those criteria provided. The output data is displayed on the webpage in a table format.

## Results
-----------------

### **Input of Search Criteria**


The desired search criteria can be input on the webpage in any of five input boxes located on the bottom left. Any search input is automatically used to filter the data without having to initiate a search.

### **Resetting the webpage and all UFO sighting data**

Resetting the page is simply a click in the upper left corner of the screen on the words "UFO Sightings". This will reload the entire webpage and refresh the data to display the entire table once more. All filters then can be re-applied to search for specfic data.

## Summary
___________________

This webpage allows for the search of any UFO sightings within the provided dataset based on five specific search criteria.

One drawback of this webpage is the lack of summary statistics that could guide a user to know what searches to make. As the webpage is currently, one would need to scroll through the initial table to determine what criteria they can input. 

In addition to a summary statistics section of the data, two other changes should be added to the webpage. The date filter input should provide a drop down of all available dates to choose from (to avoid errors in formatting) and allow for a search between multiple dates. The output data itself should include a summary table to allow a quick summary of what results returned from the search.
